If you ask yourself a question, who is the entity who is going to receive the
answer? And who is the entity who is going to enquire? If the entity is part of
consciousness, part of thought, then it is incapable of finding out. What it
can find out is only a state of awareness. But if in that state of awareness
there is still an entity who says, 'I must be aware, I must practise
awareness', that again is another image.
